/**
 Intermediate operations
    Purpose: Build the processing pipeline; each one returns another Stream and is evaluated lazily.
Examples: filter, map, flatMap, sorted, distinct, limit, skip, peek.

Terminal operations
    Purpose: End the stream pipeline, trigger execution of all intermediate operations, and produce a final 
    result or side effect (not another Stream).
Examples: forEach, collect, reduce, count, min, max, anyMatch, allMatch, noneMatch, findFirst, findAny.
