/**
 Authentication is the verification of the credentials of the connection attempt. 
 This process consists of sending the credentials from the remote access client to the 
 remote access server in an either plain text or encrypted form by using an authentication protocol.

Authorization is the verification that the connection attempt is allowed. 
Authorization occurs after successful authentication.

Authentication is stating that you are who are you are and Authorization is asking if you 
have access to a certain resource.
