 With generics, you can restrict a class to only accept objects of a given type, and

Technically, type parameters can be named anything you want. The convention is to use single, 
uppercase letters to make it obvious that they are not real class names.

    E => Element from a collection
    K => Map Key
    V => Map Value
    N => Number.
    T => Generic data type
    S, U, V, and so on => For multiple generic data types
