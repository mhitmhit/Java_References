/**
Representational State Transfer (REST)is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used 
for creating web services
REST API is a way of accessing web services in a simple and flexible way without having any processing.

All communication done via REST API uses only HTTP requests.

 Client-Server: This constraint operates on the concept that the client and the server 
 should be separate from each other and allowed to evolve individually.
 
Stateless: REST APIs are stateless, meaning that calls can be made independently of one another, 
and each call contains all of the data necessary to complete itself successfully.

Cache: Because a stateless API can increase request overhead by handling large loads of incoming 
and outbound calls, a REST API should be designed to encourage the storage of cacheable data.

Uniform Interface: The key to decoupling the client from server is having a uniform interface that 
allows independent evolution of the application without having the application’s services or models and 
actions, tightly coupled to the API layer itself.

Layered System: REST APIs have different layers of their architecture working together to build a 
hierarchy that helps create a more scalable and modular application.

Code on Demand: Code on Demand allows for code or applets to be transmitted via the API for use within the application.


API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a medium that allows different applications to 
communicate programmatically 
with one another and return a response in real time
