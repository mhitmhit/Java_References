//  OOP Pillars:
//Encapsulation:
//concept of a class. grouping behaviors and attributes together in a single entity of Object.
//using getters and setters.

//Abstraction:
//concept of a user using an object. they know the available methods, but they dont know how they are implemented.
//hiding some details, and giving access to other details.

//Polymorphism:
//concept of Overloading and Overriding.
//Overloading, is having methods with same name but parameters are different.
//Overriding, is when a method is present in different objects. the specific object method gets called.

//Inheritance:
//concept of an ObjA is an ObjB.
//referred to parent/child, superclass/child class.		

//Static: means something belongs to the class, not the object.
	
//final: when used with variables: variables are constant and cannot be changed.
//		: when used with a class: class cannot be extended.
