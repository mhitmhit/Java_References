//	Objects have:
//		- state
//		- behavior
		
		
	
//  OOP Pillars:
//Encapsulation:
//concept of a class. grouping behaviors and attributes together in a single entity of Object.
//using getters and setters for hiding fields and some methods from public access


//Abstraction:
//concept of a user using an object. they know the available methods, but they dont know how they are implemented.
//hiding some details, and giving access to other details.

//Polymorphism:
//concept of Overloading and Overriding.
//Overloading, is having methods with same name but parameters are different.
//Overriding, is when a method is present in different objects. the specific object method gets called.

//Inheritance:
//concept of an ObjA is an ObjB.
//referred to parent/child, superclass/child class.		

//Static: means something belongs to the class, not the object.
	
//final: when used with variables: variables are constant and cannot be changed.
//		: when used with a class: class cannot be extended.
	
	
	
	
// POJO / BEAN  / JAVABean / Entity / DTO:
//	class with only instance fields. used to house data and pass data between functional classes.
//	usually no methods, or few methods, might have getters and setters.
//	many dbs use POJOs to read/write data.
	
// RECORDS:
//  immutable. better suited for data transfers that do not need to be modified.
//	newly introduced to replace POJOs
//	see Student_Record.java file in notes_1 package
// 	helps in creating Objects quickly
